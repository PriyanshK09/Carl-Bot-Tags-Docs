| Name | Example | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **suggestion channel \[\#channel\]** | !suggestion channel \#cool-server-feedback | Sets a channel as the suggestion channel or creates a new one if you don't mention one. |
| **suggestion dm** | -- | Toggles between sending the person who suggested something upon a moderator deciding on it. |
| **suggestion limit &lt;number&gt;** | -- | The color of the approved/denied suggestions are based on the difference in upvotes and downvotes on the original post. This threshold is the amount of votes required for the decision to be fully green/red. |
| **suggestion move \[\#channel\]** | -- | This will let you set a secondary channel to announce the suggestions that admins have approved/denied. Just like !suggestion channel this can be left blank to create a channel. |
| **suggestion edit** | -- | Edits the message instead of reposting it in the same channel. If a move channel has been specified, it's posted there and edited in the original channel. |
| **suggestion submit** | -- | Lets you set a single channel where people are allowed to make suggestions. This can be useful if you don't want everyone to be able to make suggestions |

| **deny &lt;id&gt; \[reason\]** | !deny 6 This is literally impossible due to how discord works | Denies a suggestion |
| **consider &lt;id&gt; \[reason\]** | !consider 4 I'm not sure if this would really add that much, but if the people want it... | Marks a suggestion as being considered. |
| **implemented &lt;id&gt; \[reason\]** | !implemented 5 the command is !youtubesub \ | Marks a suggestion as implemented |
