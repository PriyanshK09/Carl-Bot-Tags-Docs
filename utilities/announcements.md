What are feeds? Feeds are a way for you to make announcements and ping a specific role without having to deal with the annoyances and potential abuse from either having a pingable role or manually toggling inbetween pingable and not.

Automatic feeds on the other hand can be seen as group reminders, and they share a lot of functionality with reminders.
