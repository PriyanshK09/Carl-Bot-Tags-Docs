### Music management

| Name | Example | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **music** | -- | Displays the music settings for the server. |
| **music announce &lt;mode&gt;** | !music announce mention | Changes the bot announcement when a new song is played, settings are off, on and mention which will ping the requester. |
| **music mode &lt;mode&gt;** | !music mode selective | Decides who can use undisruptive music commands. Values are ffa, restrictive, selective and djonly. ffa simply has no rules, everyone can always do anything. Restrictive is what I imagine 99% of servers will want to use as it restricts things like skipping, changing the volume etc. to djs and mods \(manage server\). Selective lets you choose exactly which members can use undisruptive commands. Dj only is what it says on the tin, it only lets mods and djs use any commands. |
| **music \[blacklist\|bl\] &lt;@members...&gt;** | !music bl @Carl\#0001 @Kintark\#0588 | Blacklists some members from using commands, only works for restrictive. |
| **music \[unblacklist\|unbl\] &lt;@members...&gt;**  | !music unbl @Kintark\#0588 | Unblacklists some members. |
| **music \[whitelist\|wl\] &lt;@members...&gt;** | !music wl @Carl\#0001 @Kintark\#0588 | Whitelists from members. Only works for selective. |
| **music \[unwhitelist\|unwl\] &lt;@members...&gt;** | !music unwl @Kintark\#0588 | Unwhitelists some members. |
| **music \[dj\|djrole\] \[role\]** | !music dj MUSIC OVERLORD | Sets the role as the dj role, pass no role to remove. |
| **music \[limit\|sl\|skiplimit\]**  | !music limit 3 | Total number of voteskips required to skip a song. |
| **music \[ratio\|sr\|skipratio\]**  | !music sl 65 | Percentage of non-bot, non-deafened members required to skip a song. |
| **music \[maxqueue\|mq\]**  | !music mq 300 | Limits the maximum size of the queue. |
| **music \[userqueue\|uq\]**  | !music uq 2 | Limits a member to a specified number of songs queued at once. |

#### Music commands

{% hint style="info" %}
Mod commands are as always in **bold**. Unlike normal commands however, these mod only commands are also available to DJs.
