Do not underestimate how spammy your users will be with these commands, restricting them is recommended.

| Name | Example | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| cat | -- | Gives you a random cat. All of these commands use a database of images collected by scraping reddit, this means you won't get the same 150 dogs that most bots offer through that one popular website. Currently I have about 15000 animal pictures saved. |
| dog | -- | ^ |
| aww | -- | ^ |
| catbomb | -- | Gives you 5 links instead of just one, only use this if you LOVE cats! |
| dogbomb | -- | ^ but dogs |
| awwbomb | -- | ^ but just cute animals |
