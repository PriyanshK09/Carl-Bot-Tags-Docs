Purge Commands ignore pinned messages.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Locking down a channel denies the @everyone role 'send messages' as an override in the specified channel. Any roles explicitly granting send messages will override this for anyone with that role. Locking down the server removes 'send messages' from the @everyone role. You set up your server correctly by removing send messages from all non-mod roles.
